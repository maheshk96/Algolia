If you want to know how we will judge the assignment, you can view our scoring rubric.

## Brief

Our customer Spencer and Williams have provided us with raw product data and a repo of their front end code. They have asked us for help to enhance their implementation and have asked that we create an Algolia application to demonstrate this to them.

### Technical Assignment - Part One (1 hrs)

Spencer and Williams are having a sale on cameras. They would like you create and run a demo script that reduces the price of everything in the camera category by 20% and then round to the lowest full number. They have provided the raw data as products.json. The data should be transformed and sent to algolia in a single script.

### Technical Assignment - Part Two (2 hrs)

Spencer and Williams want to use Personalization. In order to do this, they need to implement **_Algolia Insights_** . They have asked for us to create a demo of the events included in their provided codebase.

It is imperative that we send clicks and conversion on the result page hit results, any other events included will be a bonus.

### Technical Assignment - Part Three (0.5 hrs)

Spencer and Williams want some guidance on their optimal relevance set up. In the Algolia index that you have uploaded the data and events to, configure the relevance so that when users are searching, they are seeing the results that make most sense.

### Questions (0.5 hrs)

Please answer the example customer questions in the questions directory.

### Debrief Call (Dependent on submission)

After submitting the assignment, we will we ask you to present the work that you have completed in a call with two members of the customer solutions team. This will be scheduled shortly after your submission of this assignment.

## Getting started

1. You'll need to sign up for an Algolia account @ https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up.
2. You can find the product dataset in the data folder inside this repo. Feel free to use any language to perform the data transformation
3. To run the front end of the application you will need to add your app id, api key and index name to an environment file. Copy `.env.example` and rename it `.env` adding the credentials as needed. Once added run `npm install` & `npm start` to see the UI

Everything you need to complete this assignment can be found on algolia.com/docs.

## How to submit

1. Publish the working site with Netlify/ Vercel/ Github Codespaces, so that the team can see the site working
2. Share your Github repo with the team so that they can access your code to review
3. Reply to our email with a link to your publically available URL, your Github repo and anything else you think is applicable
4. Provide us with [support access](https://algolia.com/account/support/) to your algolia account

#### Github Codespaces setup

If you use Github Codespaces to publish your site, please ensure that your environment variables are set within the repo and that your Codespaces URL is public.

1. Add your environment variables for the project to the Codespace secrets:
   - In GitHub, go to your **Settings → Secrets & variables → Codespaces**, then create secrets for each of the environment variables
2. Create a Codespace within your Github repo and ensure that it is working and running as expected
   - Make sure that the port forwarding for the URL is public so that it can be accessed
